# TODO: Make index.css Fully Responsive

## Plan
- Focus on improving grid layouts for .movies-grid, .bunny-grid, and similar grids (Movies to Bunny Videos sections).
- Adjust grid-template-columns to use smaller minimum widths on smaller screens.
- Add a new breakpoint at 576px for better mobile adaptation.
- Fine-tune the gaps for better spacing.

## Steps
- [ ] Add new breakpoint at 576px for grids to ensure single column on very small screens.
- [ ] Adjust grid gaps in existing breakpoints (992px and 768px) for better spacing.
- [ ] Test responsiveness across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
